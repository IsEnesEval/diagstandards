# Technical standards for diagnostic tools

Report on the technical standards defined after gathering all the requirements. The document will emphasize on technical solutions chosen to improve the compatibility between tools

We will also define the technical architecture required to plug other diagnostic packages to existing evaluation software frameworks (such as ESMValTool), in order to foster contribution and acceptance of new diagnostics developed by the community. These requirements will be selected to allow a wide range of diagnostics to interact with the tools in a modular and structured implementation. To facilitate coupling to the tools, a common set of protocols will be used, delivered and documented [D5.2], fostering the uptake of new diagnostics.

## Style guide and coding standards

To facilitate code integration, code distribution between developers, reusability,
maintenance and readability, a [style guide](style_guide.md) is available.
