## Technical standards for plugin diagnostic tools

Report on the [technical standards](standard.md), in order to foster contribution and acceptance of new diagnostics developed by the community. These requirements will be selected to allow a wide range of diagnostics to interact with the tools in a modular and structured implementation. 

## Best practices for developing diagnostics

To facilitate code integration, code sharing between developers, reusability,
easy maintenance, and readability, a document with [best practices](best_practices.md)
is available.
This includes recommendations on the standards and style to use when writing code.
